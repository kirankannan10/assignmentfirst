           <h1><br><br> KTM SUPERBIKES</h1>
           <p> <br> KTM AG (Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen, formerly KTM Sportmotorcycle AG[4][5]) is an Austrian motorcycle, bicycle and sports car manufacturer owned by Pierer Mobility AG & Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto International Holdings BV. It was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934. Today, KTM AG is the parent company of the KTM Group, consisting of a number of motorcycle brands.

            KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars  namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes.[6]</p> <br>

                <h2>SOURCES</h2>
                <p>In 1934, an Austrian engineer Johann (Hans) Trunkenpolz[12] set up a fitter's and car repair shop[13] in Mattighofen. In 1937, he started selling DKW motorcycles, and Opel cars the following year. His shop was known as Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen, but the name was unregistered. During the Second World War, his wife took care of the business which was thriving mainly on account of diesel engine repairs.[14]

                    After the war, demand for repair works fell sharply and Trunkenpolz started thinking about producing his own motorcycles</p>

                <p> In 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a major shareholder of the company, which was renamed and registered as Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. In 1954, the R125 Tourist was introduced,[17] followed by the Grand Tourist[18] and the scooter Mirabell[19] in 1955.
                    
                    The company secured its first racing title in the 1954 Austrian 125cc national championship.[20] In 1956, KTM made its appearance at the International Six Days Trials, where Egon Dornauer won a gold medal on a KTM machine.[21]</p>

In the following years, while steadily increasing production and turnover, investing in new production and R&D facilities,[6][29][30] introducing new models and successfully sponsoring and taking part in various sports racing events, the company underwent a series of restructurings and stakeholder changes guided by KTM's managing director and Cross Industries owner Stefan Pierer.

                        <p>In 2005, KTM-Sportmotocycle began a partnership with ATV manufacturer Polaris Industries with the goal of shared research, and more importantly shared distribution networks. This partnership was a two-year trial arrangement, at the end of which both parties had the option of merging the two companies into one. In 2006, KTM announced that the partnership with Polaris had been downgraded, and would instead only supply their 450cc and 510cc RFS engines to Polaris.</p>
